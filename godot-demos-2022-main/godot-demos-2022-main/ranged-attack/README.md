# Ranged attacks

This Godot project contains three demos related to ranged attacks:

1. The main scene (`res://Demo.tscn`) shows ranged attacks with and without area of damage effects.
1. The *HomingDemo* scene (`res://homing_demo/HomingDemo.tscn`) shows how to make homing projectiles, like homing missiles.
1. The AmmoReloadingDemo scene (`res://ammo_and_reloading_demo/AmmoReloadingDemo.tscn`) focuses on managing ammo and reloading weapons.
